2. Menu delete dividers
3. Breadcrumb move into nav container
4. Add link to clickable images and titles.

Fixed mistakes:
1. change response.js to respond.js in index.html
2. change response.js file name to respond.js. 
3. *** change Rss widget class from span6 to span12. 
4. ***** move Breadcrumb widget out of navBar container, because NavBar will be fixed on top on mobile devices whil Breadcrumb won't.
5. add Timeline widget.
